									<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/trainator">Traininator</a> was submitted to <a href="https://warwickhack-2022.devpost.com/">WarwickHACK 2022</a> (at Warwick University) and won the Best HardWare Hack Sponsored By Digi-Key Registry award and also the Most Impactful award!</p>
									<p>The idea for Traininator was born a week before this hackathon. A friend and I were on our way to DurHack2022 which unfortunately coincided with a relatively bad storm, but even after the storm was over, the trains would still not work. I was at Sheffield, UK station and was told that all the staff were here, all the trains were here, etc. but an emergency schedule was being created... manually... This is obviously a big inefficiency, but also the passengers on the platform seemed to want to go to the same place! Clearly this was a place where computers can be useful... So a friend and I created an efficient scheduler which used raspberry pi's as 'physical stations' and would test the connections between each pi (the train tracks/signal etc...) and depending on how many customers want to go where it would find the most optimal way to travel!</p>
